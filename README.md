Grid Cars - a competitive racing game
============================================

Ludum Dare 31 entry. Base game made in one weekend.

Multiplayer only! This game is intended as an "in-betweener" at LAN Parties.

All cars are grid based. You have 10 seconds to make your move. Your velocity is "saved" between moves -
so the faster you went last round, the further you can go this round!

Features:
---------------------
- Multiplayer!
- Custom maps!
- Absolutely no sounds.
- Full map really DOES fit onto one screen (zoom out to see) :P
- Configurable. Take the config.lua (see github link below) and put it in:
"%APPDATA%/LOVE/GridWars/ (Win)
~/.local/share/love/GridWars (Linux + Max)

CUSTOM MAPS:
----------------------
You can create your own maps in any modeling program - we used Blender3D (export as .stl).

Once you have a cool map, send it to us, so we can share it!
